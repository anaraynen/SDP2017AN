a) Composite design pattern is a pattern used for segregating between parent and child nodes
in tree structured datatypes.

b) Composite is used when programmers want to use multiple objects in the same way, but have very
slightly different code to handle each of them and the data structure is tree structured.

c) The four participants of Composite design pattern are:

1) Component - interface for the objects inside the composition and manages the child nodes
2) Leaf - the furthest child node with no children
3) Composite - Stores the child components
4) Client - changes the objects inside the composition
