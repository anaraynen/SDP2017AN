Grain is the general currency,\nmeasured in bushels. The following will help you in your decisions:\n* Each person needs at least 20 bushels of grain per year to survive.\n* Each person can farm at most 10 acres of land.\n* It takes 2 bushels of grain to farm an acre of land.\n* The market price for land fluctuates yearly.\nRule wisely and you will be showered with appreciation at the end of\nyour term. Rule poorly and you will be kicked out of office!")
